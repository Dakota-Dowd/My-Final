        <h3 id="GettingBack">Getting Back Into Reading</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; I have always loved books, but after middle school, like many others, I slowed down on reading. I would
            collect books, but not read them. However, I ran into this video and it changed my life. The video describes a man who wanted to read 
            more books, so he talks with some experts about how to read more and why. Alongside his interviews, he visits the most beautiful
             bookstores in the world. I realized that I was missing out by buying books and not reading them, so I made the change and established a 
             reading habit.</p>

        <h3 id="Picking">Picking up Washington</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Washington came into my life in 2019. I can't remember how I got it, but I would carry Washington: A Life
            around in a box for an old Kindle that we have for some reason, pulling it out in school as a massive brick.
            Reading about a third of the way through, I eventually stopped my progress and left it aside for some
            months while I focused on school. Still, there was a lingering feeling that I wanted to finish it. To me, it was like a project that I was anxious to finish. Along with the journey of reading, I thought it would be very rewarding to have that tome on my shelf as a physical reminder of my accomplishment. </p>
        <br>

        <h3 id="Covid">Covid Comforts</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; In 2020, the covid-19 pandemic gave me a lot of time to pick up reading. I would go outside and play
            basketball, then come back inside and read Washington. I had nearly unlimited time during the day to make progress. Despite the 800 page length and the notes I was taking, I managed to finish the book. Because I didn't like marking up my books at the time, I kept my notes in little sticky notes at the back of the book. A few years later, I discovered that I enjoy marking up my books. Now I'm working through the book by marking it up based on the notes that I took. It's been a fun journey, and I'm excited to finish the project. </p>

        <h3 id="Quotes">Benefits from reading Washington: A Life</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Understanding of History
                <ul>
                    <li>I learned a lot about the American Revolution, including the culture of the revolutionaries and what made them revolt.</li>
                    <li>The role that Washington played in the establishment of the constitution was as an overseer who provided credibility, if not insights, to the convention.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Greater Empathy and Understanding
                <ul>
                    <li>I learned to empathize with Washington, even though we have somewhat different personalities.</li>
                    <li>Something that stood out to me is that Washington wasn't a master at everything. He had many insecurities and incomplete skills, but he had the most important skills that he needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
